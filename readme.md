# Pokemon TCG Database

For this project, Tyson and Liam created a database webapp using Javascript and MySQL for saving users' Pokemon Trading Card Game decks. Access to Oregon State University's classroom flip server was revoked when the project ended and Tyson is investigating a new way to host the project for a live demo.
